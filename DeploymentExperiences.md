I was able to deploy my djorg project with minimal issues which included

* specifying python runtime even though docs state 3.7.0 is supported
* setting environment variables with Heroku CLI

These issues were a result of my inexperience deploying Django projects with Heroku. The Heroku errors were clear and consie. I was able to successfully find answers in the Heroku docs and Stack Overflow queries. I do not anticipate significant issues in the future.
